## Project 1: Sum of Distinct Elements

**Task:**  
Given two arrays, return the sum of elements that appear in only one of the arrays.

**Example:**  
Input: [3, 1, 7, 9], [2, 4, 1, 9, 3]  
Output: `13` (distinct: 2, 4, 7)

## Project 2: Dot Product & Orthogonality

**Task:**  
Calculate the dot product of two vectors and check if they are orthogonal (dot product = 0).

**Example:**  
v1 = [2, 3, -6], v2 = [1, 0, 1]  
Output: `-4` â†’ Not orthogonal
